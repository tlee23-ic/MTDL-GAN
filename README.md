MTDL-GAN is a CycleGAN based model that generates multi-target directed ligands (MTDLs) from unpaired sets of inhibitor libraries. Our targets of interest are acetylcholinesterase (AChE), beta-secretase 1 (BACE1), and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3), which are known to have significant impacts on the progression and development of AD, each with a different mechanism of action. Inhibitor libraries were curated from ChEMBL27 and further characterized to represent each inhibitor domain, resulting in 69 AChE, 572 BACE1, and 246 GSK3 inhibitors. The MTDL-GAN was trained on these unpaired datasets to generate MTDL-like molecules.
